## About Me 
Hi! I'm Kaitlyn Leung, currently in 11th grade, with a strong passion for the healthcare sector. Over the last 4 months, I've dedicated my efforts in creating a machine-learning model using an image dataset. The primary objective is to provide physicians with a reliable second opinion, assisting in the prediction of early-onset breast cancer in patients.

## Abstract 
Breast cancer is a prevalent and life-threatening disease that impacts millions of people worldwide, necessitating heightened awareness and effective early detection strategies. Current methods for determining the presence and type of breast cancer in a clinical breast exam conducted by healthcare providers may be inaccurate, imprecise, and prone to error. The goal of this research project is to offer a second opinion for physicians to predict whether or not a patient has early onset breast cancer through a machine learning model developed from an image dataset, to significantly reduce the error in breast cancer staging, making the process more efficient in healthcare. Early detection is crucial for successful treatments of breast cancer, as treatment options in late-stage diagnosis of breast cancer can have a much worse prognosis. In the US, 240,000 cases of breast cancer are diagnosed per year in both men and women while the mortality rate is approximately 42,000 per year. [1] To approach this problem, I have tested an MLP Classifier, Logistic Regression, Ridge Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, Support Vector Classifier, and a trained Convolutional Neural Network to compare various results and determine the best accuracy. The Convolutional Neural Network yielded impressive outcomes, reaching up to 79% testing accuracy and 98% training accuracy. The final model exhibits the capability to identify early signs of breast cancer and differentiate between malignant and benign tumours with relatively high accuracy showing the potential of AI in combination with medical imaging can assist medical staff in diagnosis.
